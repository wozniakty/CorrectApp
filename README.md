# CorrectApp

## Description

This is a little simple app to practice implementing autocorrect (without reading guides on how to do it).  Seemed like a fun way to practice DSA stuff.
Also, gives me the opportunity to check out more Blazor stuff, .NET 5, and C# 9.0

## Demo

## Algorithms

### Autocomplete After Error
After the first letter that doesn't match any word, it suggests all the possible words matching the initial set.  More like auto-complete than auto-correct, and only captures the first error.
